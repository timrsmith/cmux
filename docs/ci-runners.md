# CI runners

Every CI/CD job picks its runner from a repository variable instead of a
hardcoded label. Changing a runner type is a single repository-variable update
that takes effect on the next workflow run.

Linux uses Blacksmith. macOS uses Blacksmith cloud runners, plus the owned
glaeda minis for the lanes the pool picker routes to them. WarpBuild is paid overflow and is
not a steady state for any lane. Non-urgent macOS work also uses free
GitHub-hosted runners through the background lane described below.

**The table below is the intended steady state, not a live readout.** Repository
variables drift, and a stale table is worse than no table. For what is actually
set right now:

```sh
gh variable list --repo manaflow-ai/cmux
```

| Variable | Used by | Intended steady state | Fallback baked into the workflow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LINUX_RUNNER` | every Linux job (`ci.yml` web/typecheck/db, presence, cloud-vm, nightly/ios decide jobs, claude, homebrew, tmux fuzz) | `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` | `blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404` |
| `LINUX_ARM64_RUNNER` | native ARM64 package entrypoint verification | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_15` | the macOS 15 default: `macos-compile-admission`, non-PR `app-host-unit-tests`, nightly helper and test-cache jobs, `iroh-release-gate.yml` streamed validation | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` | **pull-request** macOS jobs in `ci-macos.yml` (the app-host shards and `tests-build-and-lag` follow `macos-compile-admission`), `terminal-hang-diagnostics.yml`, `ci.yml` (`claude-wrapper`) and `nightly.yml` (`refresh-test-compilation-cache`) | unset (see "Lanes" below) | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` | test-only lanes that pick their Xcode by SDK and sign nothing: `test-e2e.yml`, `test-macos-suite.yml`, `test-ios.yml` (`auto`) and the `iroh-v2.yml` client | unset (see "Lanes" below) | each lane's own variable or Blacksmith label: `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` for `test-e2e.yml`, `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` for `test-macos-suite.yml`, `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` for `test-ios.yml` and `iroh-v2.yml` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` | `swift-package-tests` (SDK 15 release helper, then SDK 26 package tests) on **every** event, pull requests included, except attempt 1 of a pull request run whose picker placed it on an owned Mac (no helper build in that run; see "Pull request pool preference") | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_26` | the macOS 26 image: compatibility jobs, `release.yml` and nightly sign/notarize, the disk-heavy `release-build` universal app, and the nightly compilation-cache warmer | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE` | the larger macOS 26 machine: changed-revision universal Nightly app builds | `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26` | `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY` | macOS GUI, XCUITest, and virtual-display tests (`tests-build-and-lag`) | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` | the iOS image: simulator tests, TestFlight upload, and `ios-streamed-validate.yml` (`test-ios.yml`, `ios-testflight.yml`) | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` | `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` |
| `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` | the repository-side switch for metered capacity; gates the four paid-overflow variables above (see "Break-glass" below) | unset (free capacity) | unset means the Blacksmith fallback wins |
| `MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND` | non-urgent macOS work only: `build-ghosttykit`, the macOS legs of `cmux-tui-artifacts` (post-merge) and `cmux-tui-nightly` (on demand). See "Background lane" below | unset | `macos-15` (GitHub-hosted, free) |

A runner variable names a **machine capability** — an OS version, a GUI, a
simulator, both SDKs, or a larger instance — and every job needing that
capability reads the same one. It does not name the lane asking, which the
workflow already knows. `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` are the
deliberate lane exceptions documented below.

Two capability variables may hold the same label today and still mean different
things. `MACOS_RUNNER_26` and `MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE` both name macOS 26,
while the latter requires the larger instance.

The paid-overflow gate and the runner-value policy answer different questions.
`CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` covers only variables whose purpose is paid overflow.
Other variables, including `MACOS_RUNNER_26`, are checked by
`scripts/ci/runner_label_policy.py` through the CI health report. Gating a free
pool would make repointing it at owned hardware require enabling a flag whose
meaning is permission to spend.

The pull-request lane also has a toolchain variable, set together with
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR`:

| Variable | Used by | Intended steady state | Falls back to |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR` | the Xcode pin of the pull-request jobs that *select a pinned Xcode*: `macos-compile-admission`, `app-host-unit-tests`, `tests-build-and-lag`, the `nightly.yml` cache seed, and `ci.yml`'s pull-request build-input fingerprint | unset (see "Lanes" below) | `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15` |

Not every job on the pool reads it. `ci.yml`'s `claude-wrapper` never selects an
Xcode, and the two `terminal-hang-diagnostics.yml` jobs run
`scripts/select-ci-xcode.sh` with no pin of their own, so they take the pool
pin described next.

### Which Xcode a job gets

Every macOS job that uses Xcode runs `scripts/select-ci-xcode.sh`, and
`tests/test_ci_macos_xcode_selection.py` fails when one does not. The script
chooses, in order:

1. the job's own `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP` (the lane variables above), if set;
2. otherwise the version `scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` names for the runner's
   macOS major: Xcode 26.3 on macOS 15 and Xcode 26.6 on macOS 26 today.

Either way it stops with one `::error::` when the Xcode is below the major in
`.xcode-version` (26), or when the pinned Xcode is not installed, instead of
building with the image's default. On GitHub's `macos-15` image that default is
Xcode 16.4. When a job's own pin differs from the pool pin, the job still runs
and warns, because jobs on one pool with different Xcodes cannot share
compilation caches or products. To move a pool to a new Xcode, edit its line in
`scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` and the matching `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_*`
variable together.

The deliberate exceptions are listed with reasons in the guard's `EXEMPT`
table: the Zig-only Ghostty builds, the macOS 14 compatibility lane, and
`relay-tls.yml`'s Xcode 16.2 job.

## Lanes

Not every macOS job follows the same variable, because not every macOS job has
the same cost profile or the same urgency.

- **Required CI on `main`, the merge queue, releases and nightly** follow the
  `MACOS_RUNNER_*` variables above. This is the lane where a slow or queued
  runner blocks a merge or a ship, so it is the lane worth paying for if paid
  capacity is ever warranted.
- **Pull requests on `manaflow-ai/cmux`** resolve through `MACOS_RUNNER_PR`
  first, except the app-host unit-test matrix. Same-repository app-host
  shards are assigned per shard across `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15`,
  `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`, GitHub-hosted `macos-15`, and GitHub-hosted
  `macos-26`; fork pull requests keep those shards on the Blacksmith 15
  fallback. Other PR jobs still use `MACOS_RUNNER_PR`; unset means the
  Blacksmith fallback. PR runs are cancelled on supersession by design, so
  they are the wrong place to spend elastic paid capacity. A fork uses the
  GitHub-hosted branch described below instead.
- **Test-only lanes** (`test-e2e.yml`, `test-macos-suite.yml`, `test-ios.yml`
  on `auto`, the `iroh-v2.yml` client) resolve through
  `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` first, and deliberately do **not** follow `MACOS_RUNNER_15`.
  Setting it moves every test lane off a backed-up pool in one edit without
  touching `MACOS_RUNNER_IOS` or `MACOS_RUNNER_26`, which also route release,
  nightly, TestFlight and App Store signing. A GitHub-hosted value (`macos-15`,
  `macos-26`) is checked by each job's first step: the self-hosted fleet also
  carries a `macos-26` label, so a job that lands anywhere but GitHub-hosted
  capacity fails before checkout. `app-host-test-rerun.yml` does not follow it:
  a rerun must build with the exact Xcode the products were compiled with, so it
  stays on the Blacksmith macOS 15 pool it has always resolved to.
  Re-running one test to chase a flake should never reach for paid capacity.
  Both fallbacks stay on Blacksmith for that reason; `test-e2e.yml` falls back
  to macOS 26 because the macOS 15 pool's queue-to-start p90 was 83 min against
  1.0 min on 26, measured over 60 dispatches on 2026-09-22/23.
  `scripts/run-e2e.sh` then sends commits whose SHA ends in an odd hex digit
  to `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26`, so the two instance sizes are compared on
  real focused-run traffic. It splits only that free default: a
  `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` value naming any other pool is used unchanged.

### Pull request pool preference

When `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` is `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26`, `ci.yml`'s `changes`
job picks one pool for the whole pull request run with
`scripts/ci/pr_runner_pool.py`, and every pull-request macOS job in the run
reads it: compile admission and its product consumers, `tests-build-and-lag`,
`claude-wrapper` and `remote-daemon.yml`. A run is
never split across pools, so the app-host product always meets the Xcode that
linked it. The run takes the pool in `CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` with the least
expected wait and no queued release or nightly job: the queue its job joins
in rounds (queued jobs over capacity) times a job's length there (5 minutes
on 12vcpu, 10 elsewhere). Owned pools come first and take the run while its
jobs start there no later than on the best Blacksmith pool, within
`CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` job lengths, and while everything the runs holding
the pool will need at their peak, plus this run's, stays within machines x
(1 + rounds). A pool's
capacity is what it ran at most while jobs queued behind it
(`POOL_CAPACITIES`): 5 for 12vcpu, 10 for each 6vcpu pool. At 23:16Z on
2026-09-24, counted at 10, 12vcpu ran 3 with 18 queued while macOS 15 ran 1
of 10. When every pool is full, the run takes the shortest queue in rounds
(queued jobs over capacity). The macOS 15 pool counts one round more
(`COLD_ROUNDS`): the DerivedData seed exists only for the lane's Xcode, so a
run there compiles cold, 10 to 20 minutes longer, about one job's length.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW` | unset (on) | `0` turns the preference off; every job takes its `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` route |
| `CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` | `blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26,blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26,blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` | preference order; only pools whose Xcode pin `pr_runner_pool.py` knows are accepted, and an unknown label turns the preference off |
| `CI_PR_POOL_MAX_QUEUED` | `0` | with `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS=0` only: a Blacksmith pool still takes a run with up to this many macOS jobs queued once it arrives |
| `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` | `1` | the most job lengths a run's jobs may expect to wait on an owned pool (at most `3`); within that they queue there while they would start no later than on Blacksmith, and the peaks of the runs holding it stay within machines x (1 + rounds). `0` is the kill switch and restores the old rule exactly: an owned pool only when the run's peak is free counting every run's peak, and a full Blacksmith pool rolls over at once |

The two macOS 26 pools share the lane's Xcode. A run on
`blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` builds with `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15`, the pool
and Xcode `main`'s own compile admission uses, and the build-input fingerprint
follows that Xcode. Every Blacksmith pool is sponsored, so cost does not rank
them; the order is speed first.

The queue comes from the queue janitor: each sweep publishes the per-pool demand
it already listed as the `macos-pool-load` artifact, and the `changes` job
reads the newest copy uploaded from `main` of this repository. Pull request
runs created since that sweep and still in flight are replayed through the
same rule first, each
filling a pool's idle slots (about 10 per Blacksmith macOS pool, less what is
running) before it counts as queued, so a burst of pushes spreads across
pools. The whole choice costs three API
requests. A snapshot older than 45 minutes, an API error, or any event other
than `pull_request` keeps today's route. The step summary of `changes` names
the pool, the reason, and the queue it saw.

A fork pull request gets no repository variables, so the janitor copies
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and the three settings above into the snapshot and fork runs
follow those: `CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW=0` or a lane other than
`blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26` keeps them on the Blacksmith macOS 15 fallback as
before. Fork runs never pin an Xcode (each job selects its pool's newest SDK
26 Xcode) and only use ephemeral `blacksmith-*` pools.

Owned Mac minis (fleet RFC cmuxterm-hq#573) join as class pools keyed by the
label glaeda issues to a dedicated member once it has verified the pinned
Xcode build: `glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>`, today `glaeda-std-xcode-26.6`.
The version comes from `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR`, so moving that pin moves the
pool, and no machine carries the new label until glaeda has verified the new
Xcode on it. With `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED=1` the default order is
`glaeda-std-xcode-<version>` (48 GB minis), then `glaeda-light-xcode-<version>`
(16 GB), then the Blacksmith pools as overflow. An owned pool's capacity is its entry in
`CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS`, and the janitor's snapshot counts the jobs queued and
running on that label. A pull request run puts several macOS jobs on its pool
at once, each on its own machine, so a run takes the owned pool only when its
own peak fits there by the expected wait above. The picker runs after the suite choice and counts
that peak from the run's routing: the Claude wrapper and remote daemon lanes
(and swift-package-tests when the run builds no Release helper, below),
beside the larger of compile admission alone or what follows it (a full
suite's seven app-host shards, tests-build-and-lag and cli-product-tests, 11
jobs in all; a changed-suites run's one shard; a CLI
change's cli-product-tests). The wait counts the jobs the janitor saw queued
and running there, and each run created since the snapshot at what it holds:
admission and its side lanes while it is younger than a job length (10
minutes), its whole marker peak after, when its shards exist. A run still
picking counts 3 machines. So an idle mini is never held for a shard that
does not exist yet; the shard joins the label's queue when it does, and
GitHub hands out runners in queue order. The peaks (the janitor's `committed`
and the markers) bound the queue. With `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS=0` every
run counts its whole peak against the machines, as before.
It is skipped when the snapshot is older than 20
minutes or the label has no slots, and it is never the fewest-queued fallback.
Fork runs and retry attempts never take it. While `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` is off,
owned labels in `CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` are dropped and the rest of the order is
used; an owned label for another Xcode than the lane's pin is dropped the same
way and named in the `changes` summary. An order left empty by that turns the
preference off. A pin path that is not `/Applications/Xcode_<version>.app`
names no owned pool.

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` | unset (off) | `1` puts owned pools first and turns on the rescue below |
| `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS` | unset (no slots) | JSON, owned pool label to machine count, the `conforming_count` from `glaeda-mini-fleet pools --json`: `{"glaeda-std-xcode-26.6": 12, "glaeda-light-xcode-26.6": 2}`. A class (`{"std": 12, "light": 2}`) or a bare count (`12`, the std class) means that class at the lane's Xcode pin |
| `CI_OWNED_MAIN_RESERVE` | `0` | machines, and root runners, main's full-suite dispatch leaves free for pull requests; above 0 it takes an owned pool only whole (below) |
| `GLAEDA_ROUTE_APP_ID` + secret `GLAEDA_ROUTE_APP_KEY` | unset (snapshot only) | the org's `manaflow-glaeda-route` App. `ci.yml`'s `changes` job mints a token with `administration: read` for same-repository pull requests and main's full-suite dispatch only, on its ephemeral Linux runner, and the picker lists the repository's runners: the online, idle runners carrying an owned label are that pool's free machines, less what runs of the last `LIVE_WINDOW_MINUTES` took. That replaces `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS` and the snapshot's owned counts and age. Any failure falls back to them |
| `CI_OWNED_LIGHT_RETRY` | unset (off) | `1` lets attempt 2, the full re-run the rescue starts for a job stuck on a full `std` pool, take the `light` pool when the run's whole owned peak is free there and `github-actions[bot]` started the re-run (a person's re-run of attempt 2 stays on Blacksmith). The rescue watches that attempt like attempt 1, and a job stuck or refused there goes to Blacksmith on attempt 3. Only while it is on do the janitor and the picker look up attempt 2's marker. Order: std, light, Blacksmith |

Main's full suite: `ci-main-full-suite.yml` dispatches `ci.yml` on main about
32 times a day, each a full suite. Until this change every one ran compile
admission and the seven app-host shards on Blacksmith (p50 wall about 37
minutes; admission 887 s on 6vcpu against 663 s on a mini with a 2 s queue).
The dispatch runs main's own code, so the picker places it like a
same-repository pull request, split and the `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` queue
allowance included, on the owned pools only: jobs that do not fit keep
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` as before. Its run holds 9 root runners
at peak (admission's, then 7 shards, tests-build-and-lag and cli-product-tests);
the Claude wrapper and remote daemon lanes route only for pull requests, so they
are not counted. `CI_OWNED_MAIN_RESERVE` above 0 holds that many machines and
root runners back for pull requests, and then main takes the pool only whole
and only while its peak is free now, with no queue allowance. Main's CI concurrency group
runs one dispatch at a time, so main never holds more than one run's machines.
Its marker, the janitor's `committed` count, the route replay in newer picks,
the owned Mac's kept build state and the rescue all treat it like a
same-repository pull request run. A retry attempt, a dispatch on another
branch, or `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` off keeps its route.

Each entry of `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS` that is not an owned label or class with a
positive whole number of machines counts as none. A full label wins over its
class. While owned pools are on, the `changes` job raises a workflow error
annotation and a summary line for each such entry,
so a typo shows up on every run instead of quietly leaving a pool unused.

Root runners: glaeda gives compile admission, the app-host shards,
tests-build-and-lag, cli-product-tests and E2E jobs a mini's one canonical-root
token and refuses such a job on a mini whose token is taken. It also labels
one runner per mini `glaeda-root-<class>-xcode-<version>`. A root count in
`CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS` (`"root-std": 10`, or the full root label) sends those
jobs to the root label, where they wait for a free root instead of being
refused, and the picker places no more of them than the root runners free.
The janitor counts a root job toward the root label and its pool. Without a
root count every job keeps the pool label. The CLI pipe, remote daemon and
Claude wrapper lanes always do. A root count above its pool's is an error.
With 8 std minis and 2 light ones:
`{"std": 32, "light": 4, "root-std": 8, "root-light": 2}`.

Warm affinity (`CI_OWNED_WARM_LABELS=1`, off by default): an owned Mac keeps
compile admission's DerivedData, and admission uploads the main commits that
build starts from cheaply (`owned_build_state.py warm-keys`). When the CI run
completes, `ci-owned-warm-labels.yml` (from main, with the route App's
administration: write) labels the runner that ran admission
`glaeda-warm-<sha12>` for each, at most 4, and removes those labels from the
other runners of its root pool, so one runner per pool carries each commit.
With live runners, the picker sends a run's admission to
`["<root label>", "glaeda-warm-<merge base sha12>"]` when an idle root runner
carries that label (the `admission_runner` output, attempt 1 only); otherwise
admission takes the root label as before. The picker also reads the variable, so
turning it off ignores labels already set. v1 matches the merge base exactly;
it does not rank runners by commit distance. A warm runner taken between the
pick and the queue leaves admission waiting, and the rescue moves it to
Blacksmith like any other stuck owned job.

An owned pool is persistent, which needs one more rule because GitHub never
re-routes a queued job: one queued there waits for that pool however long it
stays busy. An offline mini still counts as a slot, and the snapshot can be
minutes old. When the picker chooses a persistent pool, `changes`
uploads a `macos-pool-persistent-<run>-<attempt>-<jobs>-<pool>` marker (the
janitor reads the run's peak and pool from its name), and the
`owned-pool-watch` job dispatches `ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml` (from `main`, with
Actions write) to watch that run. A run on an ephemeral pool starts no watcher.
If one of its jobs waits for a persistent runner longer than
`CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS` (default 90, 30 to 600) past the wait a CI
run's owned job may expect (900 seconds per `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` round,
since any of its jobs may queue behind runs accepted later), the watcher
confirms the
pull request head has not moved, cancels the run, and re-runs it. For main's
full-suite dispatch it checks main's HEAD instead: once main has moved past
the run's commit, the run is cancelled but not re-run, because its completion
makes `ci-main-full-suite.yml` dispatch the newer HEAD; a refused job on
main's run gets its failed jobs re-run whether or not main moved. A retry
attempt never takes a persistent pool, so the re-run lands on Blacksmith as a
whole, and so does a manual "Re-run all jobs".

An owned runner can also refuse a job: glaeda's job-started hook exits 1 when
the host is busy, and the job fails within seconds. GitHub does not retry it.
The watcher treats a job on the persistent pool that failed within 120
seconds of starting, with no workflow step succeeded, as refused. It confirms
the head has not moved, cancels the run if it is still going, and re-runs its
failed jobs, so nobody has to. That attempt 2 keeps what passed and sends the
rest to `retry_runner` (below). Products built on a mini are then tested on
Blacksmith, which is sound only while both carry the same Xcode build: on
2026-09-24 the minis and Blacksmith's 6vcpu and 12vcpu macOS 26 images all
reported Xcode 26.6 build 17F113 (jobs 107712770707 and 107710434810).

A refused job goes back to the fleet once before Blacksmith. Attempt 2 may
take the owned pool again where a job's `runs-on` reads
`github.run_attempt == 2 && inputs.pr_refused_retry_runner` first. GitHub
sends no `requested` event for a re-run, so the watch that re-ran the failed
jobs follows attempt 2 itself, until its owned jobs have run past the
120-second refusal window. A job refused, or queued past the budget, on
attempt 2 gets its failed jobs re-run once more, keeping what passed, and
attempt 3 and later always take `retry_runner` on Blacksmith, so a busy fleet
costs at most one extra refusal and never loops.

"Re-run failed jobs" is different: `changes` passed, so it is not re-run, and
the failed jobs read attempt 1's outputs, owned pool included, with no watcher
(the rescue follows attempt 1 only). So a persistent choice also names
`retry_runner`, the Blacksmith pool the same rule picks on the lane's own
Xcode, which is also the Xcode the owned label names. Every pull request macOS
`runs-on`, and the app-host shards that otherwise inherit compile admission's
pool, reads `github.run_attempt > 1 && inputs.pr_retry_runner` first. It is
empty for a run on Blacksmith, so those re-run where they ran.

Compile admission on an owned Mac keeps its build state between jobs
(`scripts/ci/owned_build_state.py`) under `/Users/Shared/cmux-build-fleet/ci`:
the admission DerivedData, stamped with the canonical fingerprint (Xcode build,
canonical paths, file-system mode), and the resolved Swift packages. When the
kept DerivedData matches, the SwiftPM cache restore and the nightly seed are
skipped, and the compile, which compares inputs by checksum, rebuilds only what
changed since the last job on that Mac. The kept packages resolve with a fetch
of what changed rather than a cache restore. The first run on cmux11s spent 25
minutes on the ephemeral flow instead (run 36048804178). Any mismatch or miss
falls back to that flow, and a DerivedData over 40 GB is dropped. Only a
successful compile's DerivedData is kept, cloned right after the compile,
before the staging and packaging steps rewrite Build/Products. Only pull
request runs and main's full-suite dispatch keep or read this state; a main
run leaves the Mac warm for the main commit the next pull requests merge onto. Moves are renames on one volume, glaeda's host lock keeps one job
per Mac, and nothing is uploaded: an owned run writes only its own Mac's state.
The four steps are non-product recipe steps (`product_input_identity.py`), so
no pool's product key changes. Blacksmith and fork runs never take them.

The queue janitor treats an owned label as one more macOS pool. A stale pull
request run (category b: closed, merged or superseded) is cancelled there on
every sweep whatever the queue, which frees minis for current work. The other
categories cancel only while more than `CI_JANITOR_QUEUE_THRESHOLD` jobs queue
on a pool the run holds, owned pools included. With `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED=1` the
janitor also lists the artifacts of each in-flight attempt-1, same-repository
pull request CI run or main full-suite dispatch (one request per run, more only past 100 artifacts) to
read its marker's peak into `committed`. A run's other macOS jobs do not rule
it out: `swift-package-tests` runs on Blacksmith beside a full suite on an
owned pool whenever that suite also builds the Release helper.

`swift-package-tests` is an owned side lane (`swift-package` in `owned_jobs`)
only in a run that builds no Release Ghostty helper: a package change under
the compile-only policy, or a full suite with `release_build` false. The
helper needs an SDK 15 Xcode that only Blacksmith's macOS 15 image carries
(the minis have Xcode 26.6 alone), so a full suite with `release_build`
keeps it there (`pr_runner_pool.package_lane_owned()`). On the owned label it
takes the lane's Xcode (`CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP` restates the runs-on condition);
every other attempt keeps the macOS 15 pool and pin. Like the other side
lanes it takes the pool's side label (`pr_side_runner`) when the picker names
one, so it never holds a mini's root runner. With it a full suite without the
helper holds 12 machines at peak (`MAX_RUN_JOBS`).

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE` | unset (on while `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` is 1) | `0` turns the watcher off |
| `CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS` | `90` | how long a job may wait for a persistent runner before the run moves to Blacksmith; a CI run's owned job gets 900 s more per `CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS` round, the wait it may expect |

The watcher makes no API request while owned pools are off. A run on an
ephemeral pool costs it a few jobs listings until `changes` finishes, plus one
artifact listing.

The guard keeps the picker the only way onto an owned pool.
`check_no_self_hosted_fleet_runners` refuses any `glaeda-*` label in workflow
text, and `runner_label_policy.py` refuses one in any `*RUNNER*` variable, so
neither a workflow edit nor `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` can send a job there.
`check_owned_pools_route_through_picker` requires the picked label to reach
jobs only as `pr_runner` or on a `pull_request` `runs-on` branch. `ci-macos.yml`
reads those inputs for a `workflow_dispatch` on `refs/heads/main` too, which
the picker fills only for main's full-suite dispatch.
`CI_PR_POOL_ORDER` is the one variable that may name owned labels (the guard's
`owned` pattern, which must match `pr_runner_pool.OWNED_LABEL`), and the CI
health report checks every other entry in it against the workflow policy.
Owned pools stay off until `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` is 1 and `CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS`
gives the lane's owned label machines.

`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` does not move a lane on its own. A runner change and its
Xcode pin still have to agree, because `scripts/select-ci-xcode.sh` exits
non-zero on a pinned path that is absent.

Every job that consumes the compile-admission product runs on
`macos-compile-admission`'s pool and pins its Xcode. `app-host-unit-tests`
reads both from the admission's `runner` and `xcode_app` outputs, so it follows
any routing change there. `tests-build-and-lag` restates the admission's
expressions (paid overflow may move its non-PR runs to `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY`
under the same macOS 15 pin), and `tests/test_ci_change_areas.py` fails when
the two drift apart. The cmuxTests bundle only
loads under the Xcode that linked it: a bundle linked by 26.6 (`macos-26`)
imports Testing.framework symbols 26.3 (`macos-15`) lacks and fails to dlopen
before running a test. `app_host_test_products.py restore` refuses a product
built by a newer Xcode than the job's, naming both, as well as another
revision, architecture or major Xcode. `app-host-test-rerun.yml` runs on the
Blacksmith pool whose macOS matches the source run's compile admission.

For the other pull-request jobs, the pin follows `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` through
`CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR`, and the two are set together:

```bash
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_PR --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b /Applications/Xcode_26.3.app
```

Unsetting both returns the lane to `blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15` and Xcode 26.3.

`swift-package-tests` deliberately does **not** resolve through
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` (the owned side lane above is the one exception, and it
never runs the helper steps). It builds the Release Ghostty CLI helper against an
SDK 15 Xcode -- it pins `CMUX_CI_REQUIRED_MACOS_SDK_MAJOR=15` for that step
and then asserts `HELPER_SDK_VERSION == 15.*` -- and only the `macos-15`
image carries an SDK 15 Xcode. That pin dates from Zig 0.15.2, whose MachO
linker could not resolve `libSystem` against an Xcode 26.4+ SDK
(ziglang/zig#31658, fixed by #31673 in Zig 0.16.0); the Ghostty submodule has
required 0.16.0 since 2026-09-17 and `install-zig-ci.sh` reads the version from
that manifest, so the original reason is probably gone. The SDK 15 assertion is
what still holds the job, and it has not been retested on a macos-26 image. So
it stays on `MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` on every event, and the dual-Xcode guard in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` fails if it ever reads
`MACOS_RUNNER_PR`.
`test_macos_jobs_use_lane_specific_xcode_pin_vars` in
`tests/test_ci_change_areas.py` keeps the pin on the same escape hatch as the
pool.

`MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` are escape hatches: leaving them
unset is the intended state, and setting one overrides just that lane without
touching required CI. That makes a rollback a variable edit rather than a
revert.

A job that also reports its own pool in an env value must read that value from
the same expression its `runs-on` uses, not from the lane variable alone.
`macos-compile-admission` puts `CMUX_PRODUCT_RUNNER` in the compiled product
contract and `tests-build-and-lag` validates `REQUESTED_RUNNER`; on a pull
request both resolve through `MACOS_RUNNER_PR`, so a job reading only
`MACOS_RUNNER_15` or `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY` would stamp and check a pool it is
not on. `check_macos_runner_identity_env_tracks_routing` in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` enforces that.

Every workflow exercised by a `pull_request` — including local reusable
workflows reached through `workflow_call` — has an explicit repository-owner
branch before runner variables are consulted. On `manaflow-ai/cmux`, existing
repository variables and their Blacksmith fallbacks behave exactly as above. On
every other owner, Linux jobs use `ubuntu-24.04` and macOS jobs use
`macos-26` from GitHub Actions: the image and Xcode (26.6) main compiles with,
so a fork's own CI can hit main's caches, which anyone can read from
`https://ci-cache.cmux.com`. Only the jobs that build the SDK 15 Ghostty CLI
helper (`swift-package-tests`, release and nightly), `plain-paste-worker.yml`'s
`macos-15` job and `ci-macos-compat.yml`'s macOS 15 row keep a `macos-15` fork
branch, because they need that image. Fork jobs set no Xcode pin, so they take
the pool pin from `scripts/ci/xcode-pins.txt` (26.6 on `macos-26`, the Xcode
main compiles with). When a hosted image no longer carries that Xcode, a fork
falls back to the image's newest stable Xcode with a warning, so a newer image
Xcode is a cache miss, never a failure. Runs in `manaflow-ai` fail on a missing
pool Xcode instead. The self-hosted guard allows a literal `macos-26` only in this exact
`github.repository_owner != 'manaflow-ai' && 'macos-26'` form, which evaluates
solely outside `manaflow-ai`, where the fleet's `macos-26` label does not exist.

Scheduled, dispatched and push-only workflows take the same owner branch, so
a fork's own nightly, release, SDK and dispatch runs never wait on Blacksmith
either. Dispatch inputs that default to a Blacksmith label (`reload-build.yml`,
`test-e2e.yml`, `test-ios.yml`, `perf-activation.yml`) are overridden by the
owner branch; `test-e2e.yml` applies it to the pool its runner job picks. The
Blacksmith Testbox warmup has no hosted equivalent, so it is skipped outside
`manaflow-ai`.

That is the fork contract: **a fork needs zero runner variables and zero runner
provider setup to run its workflows.** Blacksmith is an
organization-level GitHub App; naming a `blacksmith-*` label in a personal
fork does not produce a useful error, it leaves the job queued indefinitely.
The fork branch therefore short-circuits before any `MACOS_RUNNER_*` or
`LINUX_RUNNER` value can select organization-only capacity.

A fork pull request into `manaflow-ai/cmux` runs with `repository_owner ==
'manaflow-ai'`, so the owner branch does not catch it. Any runner variable can
name a self-hosted machine, so every expression in the pull-request graph that
reads `MACOS_RUNNER_*`, `LINUX_RUNNER` or `LINUX_ARM64_RUNNER` first takes

```
github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name != github.repository && '<Blacksmith fallback>'
```

as a top-level alternative, ahead of any variable. The guard parses each
expression rather than matching text, so this branch nested under another
condition (for example the paid-overflow switch) does not count.

`tests/test_ci_fork_runner_routing.py` discovers every `pull_request`
workflow, recursively follows its local reusable-workflow calls, and requires
every variable-routed `runs-on` in that closure to contain a hosted fork
branch. Across every workflow, it also rejects a Blacksmith label that a
zero-configuration run outside `manaflow-ai` could select: each expression
holding one must start with the owner branch, unless the job itself is
owner-gated or the line is allow-listed there with a reason. The upstream branch still keeps literal Blacksmith fallbacks so deleting
a repository variable cannot silently change `manaflow-ai/cmux` capacity.

## Background lane

`MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND` moves macOS work that nobody is waiting on off the
shared macOS pool. Every other macOS job shares one Blacksmith pool (with paid
Warp as overflow), and pull request CI queues on it for 30-60+ minutes at peak.
The repository is public, so standard GitHub-hosted macOS runners are free with
unlimited minutes (about five concurrent jobs, 3-core M1, 7 GB RAM). They are
slower per job, which is fine for work that is not on a merge path.

A job belongs in the lane only if all of these hold:

- it is dispatch-only, scheduled, or runs after merge; never `pull_request`,
  `pull_request_target`, `merge_group`, or `workflow_call` (the guard enforces
  this per workflow);
- it fits 3 cores and 7 GB: scripts, a single package, a Rust or Zig build,
  uploads; not a full app or app-host XCTest build;
- it is not a timing benchmark or incremental-build probe, whose numbers only
  compare on the same hardware;
- it does not need a GUI console session.

Members today: `build-ghosttykit.yml` (Xcode from the image default, Zig
xcframework build), and the two macOS Rust legs of `cmux-tui-artifacts.yml`
and `cmux-tui-nightly.yml` (passed as `macos_runner` to
`cmux-tui-build-package.yml`; release and merge-gate callers keep their own
runner).

The fallback is `macos-15`, never `macos-26`: the self-hosted fleet carries a
`macos-26` label and GitHub prefers a matching self-hosted runner. The
`macos-15` image ships Xcode 26.3 (macOS 26.2 SDK) next to its 16.4 default, so
jobs that pin `CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15` resolve there too.

An admin can repoint the whole lane with one variable edit, for example back
to Blacksmith if GitHub's macOS queue is ever the slower one:

```bash
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
```

Leaving it unset is the intended state.

## Owned Macs for pull request compiles

The persistent compile-admission pilot (`persistent-macos-compile.yml`, its
router, and `CI_PERSISTENT_MAC_COMPILE`) was retired before it routed any
pull request.
Owned minis serve pull request runs through the pool picker instead; see
"Pull request pool preference" above.

### Side lanes on owned minis

Seven light macOS jobs outside `ci.yml` have no picker: iroh-v2 `client`,
cloud-command-deadlines `command-regressions`, terminal-hang-diagnostics
`portal-reconciliation` and `phase-attribution`, cloud-task-local-tests and
cloud-machine-tests `lifecycle`, relay-tls `diagnostic-presentation`, and
auth-refresh-tests. Each is `swift test` or `swiftc` into the workspace or a
temporary directory, with no GUI, keychain, fixed port or canonical root.
When `vars.CI_SIDE_LANE_RUNNER` names a `glaeda-side-<class>-xcode-<version>`
label and `CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` is 1, attempt 1 of a same-repository pull request
run takes that label. glaeda puts it only on a mini's non-root runners, so a
side lane never holds a root runner a compile or app-host job is waiting for,
and glaeda's hook classes these job ids as light. Forks, retries and other
events keep the Blacksmith default. ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml watches these
runs while the variable is set and re-runs a job that waits past
`CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS`, or is refused, on Blacksmith.

relay-tls `system-keychain` (it changes the System keychain trust store),
plain-paste-worker (macOS 15 only) and app-host-test-rerun (a fixed canonical
root) stay on Blacksmith. Clear the variable to send every side lane back.

### Which macOS jobs may take an owned Mac

Owned minis run macOS 26 with Xcode 26.6 only, run same-repository pull
request code, and keep their home directory and caches between jobs. So a job
stays on Blacksmith when it signs, notarizes, uploads or publishes (anything
with signing, store or release secrets, or whose output ships or seeds a
shared cache), when it runs fork code, or when it needs an OS or Xcode the
minis lack. Everything else routes through a picker, with Blacksmith as the
overflow and ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml as the way off a busy or refusing mini.

| Jobs | Route | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ci-macos.yml` compile admission, app-host shards, `tests-build-and-lag`, `cli-product-tests` | owned via `pr_runner_pool.py` (root label), pull requests and main's full-suite dispatch | canonical-root jobs |
| `ci.yml` `claude-wrapper`, `remote-daemon.yml` macOS tests | owned side lane via the picker (the side label) | light |
| `ci-macos.yml` `swift-package-tests` | owned side lane via the picker (the side label) when the run builds no Release helper; else Blacksmith macOS 15 | the helper needs an SDK 15 Xcode |
| the seven side-lane workflows above | `CI_SIDE_LANE_RUNNER` on attempt 1 of a pull request | light; other events stay on Blacksmith |
| `test-e2e.yml` (and `dispatch-focused-test.py`) | owned via `e2e_runner_pool.py`; UI runs with `CI_E2E_OWNED_UI=1` | root jobs; Blacksmith when no root runner is free |
| `test-ios.yml`, `ios-screenshots.yml` | owned via `ios_runner_pool.py` behind `CI_IOS_OWNED=1` | needs the `glaeda-ios-sim` label (an iOS 26.x simulator runtime) |
| `app-host-test-rerun.yml` `rerun` | Blacksmith | restores a product into a fixed canonical root; needs a root route and a glaeda class first |
| `cmux-tui.yml` macOS `lint`, `test`, `cdp-browser-smoke` | Blacksmith | could move; glaeda classes unknown ids as compile (root), and these ids are generic |
| `ci-macos.yml` `release-build` | `MACOS_RUNNER_26` | could move; needs a picker key and a glaeda class |
| low-volume dispatches: `test-macos-suite`, `tmux-corpus`, `perf-activation`, command palette benchmarks, `iroh-release-gate` version skew | Blacksmith or the caller's runner input | a few runs a week; benchmarks want a quiet machine |
| `relay-tls` `system-keychain` | Blacksmith | edits the System keychain trust store |
| `plain-paste-worker`, `ci-macos-compat`, `seed-swiftpm-manifests`, release and nightly Ghostty helpers | Blacksmith macOS 15 / 14 | an OS or SDK the minis lack |
| `release.yml`, nightly sign/notarize, `ios-testflight`, `ios-app-store`, `ios-appstore-upload` | Blacksmith | signing and store secrets |
| nightly app and compilation caches, `seed-derived-data` Blacksmith pools, `build-ghosttykit`, `cmux-tui-build-package` (artifacts, nightly, release), `relay-publish-npm` | Blacksmith | publish, or write a cache other runs trust, with R2 or release secrets |
| `ios-streamed-validate`, `iroh-release-gate` simulator E2E | Blacksmith | secrets in the job, fixed ports, GUI session changes |

## Retired: Tart VM fleet

The `tart-*` runner choices (`tart-canary`, `tart-dual` and `tart-small` in
`test-e2e.yml`, `tart-ios` in `test-ios.yml`) were removed on 2026-09-25.
Every Tart VM (the AWS EC2 Mac hosts, runners `tart-cmux-aws-m4pro-*`) was
offline, jobs that picked one queued for hours, and the hosts cost money while
allocated. The owned glaeda minis plus Blacksmith cover the load.

To bring it back, revert the pull request that removed it. That restores the
dispatch options, the runner identity steps (runner name `tart-cmux-*` and the
`/etc/cmux-tart-ci` marker), the `tart-canary` label in
`.github/actionlint.yaml`, and the fleet-label guard's allowlist for those
option lines. Then point the runner variables at the fleet again. See #14101
and #14106 for the earlier removal and its revert.

## Shared physical-host interoperability

The current required-CI policy continues to use hosted providers or owned
pools reached through the pool picker. Any future path that executes directly on shared CMUX-owned hardware
must preserve a separate caller identity, semantic workload request, and
machine-local physical lease.

Examples of callers that may share a host include GitHub Actions, `cmux-ci`,
developer/build tooling, direct agents, operator commands, and reviewed fleet
schedulers. They keep their own workflow state. The host-side execution adapter
owns fresh admission, resource ownership, bounded execution, and settlement.

A scheduler may select a candidate node. That selection stays advisory until
the node rechecks current drain/pressure/resource state and acquires its local
lease. When the CMUX controller already holds a machine or resource reservation,
the host adapter validates that reservation's owner, scope, generation, and
expiry, then binds local execution to it. It never creates an unrelated
competing reservation for the same resource.

Scarce local claims include native build lanes, heavy Linux slots,
project-native locks, artifact-publisher slots, and resident workspaces.
Participating adapters use one collision boundary for those claims. Runner
liveness, process names, and apparent idleness are observation only.

Execution receipts correlate the caller class and external request reference
with the semantic workload, opaque node identity/class, local lease generation,
result, and cleanup/settlement. Caller-private workflow state remains in the
caller.

Hosted/isolated fallback remains available when the shared host refuses local
admission or is draining, pressured, or unavailable.

## Break-glass: switch a runner type to a paid provider

There is no automatic overflow for the runner variables. If a pool is
unavailable or its queue is too long, set the affected variable to a paid
provider.

Four runner variables exist to name **metered WarpBuild capacity**, so they are
read through a second switch that lives in this repository rather than in
repository settings:

| | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` unset or not `1` | `MACOS_RUNNER_15`, `MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY`, `MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE` and `MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE` are **not read**; every lane takes its free Blacksmith fallback |
| `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW` = `1` | those four variables select the pool |

Turning paid capacity **on** therefore needs two admin actions: a runner variable
pointing at Warp *and* `CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW=1`. Turning it **off** needs
either — including a pull request anyone with push access can merge. Between
2026-09-19 and 2026-09-23 these four variables, plus the former release-specific
runner variable now folded into `MACOS_RUNNER_26`, pointed at Warp, so main and
the merge queue ran metered while pull requests ran free.

`MACOS_RUNNER_26` stays ungated because it names the ordinary free macOS 26
pool used by several jobs. Its safety check is the value policy described above.
Moving `release-build` onto a paid pool therefore takes one admin action:
repointing `MACOS_RUNNER_26`.

`tests/test_ci_repo_variable_defaults.py` fails if a workflow reads one of the
four paid-overflow variables without the gate, and
`scripts/ci/ci_health_report.py` reports how many metered runner minutes each
window actually contained.

```bash
gh variable set CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b 1   # enable paid overflow
gh variable delete CI_PAID_MACOS_OVERFLOW --repo manaflow-ai/cmux     # back to free capacity
```

```bash
gh variable set LINUX_RUNNER          --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404
gh variable set LINUX_ARM64_RUNNER    --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b ubuntu-24.04-arm
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_15         --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_DUAL_XCODE --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_26         --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_26_LARGE   --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_DISPLAY    --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15
gh variable set MACOS_RUNNER_IOS        --repo manaflow-ai/cmux -b blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26
```

Leave `MACOS_RUNNER_PR` and `MACOS_RUNNER_TESTS` unset.
They exist to hold the pull-request and manual test lanes on Blacksmith
independently of whatever the pool above is set to.

Check current values:

```bash
gh variable list --repo manaflow-ai/cmux
```

## Manual runs

`perf-activation.yml` and `test-e2e.yml` keep a `runner` choice input that
defaults to `auto`. Manual `auto` runs follow `MACOS_RUNNER_15` then the Blacksmith
fallback, so flipping the repo variable redirects those workflows. An explicit
manual choice wins over the variable; both dropdowns expose Blacksmith, Warp,
and `depot-macos-*` choices, with a Depot identity guard for GUI-activation
runs. These choices are available only through `workflow_dispatch`.

## Guard

`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` (run by the `workflow-guard-tests` job)
asserts that no job pins a bare GitHub-hosted runner (`ubuntu-*` / `macos-NN`):
every job must route through a runner repo variable so the overflow switch stays
a single variable flip. A GitHub-hosted macOS label may appear only as the
`MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND` fallback (`vars.MACOS_RUNNER_BACKGROUND || 'macos-15'`)
in a workflow with no pull request, merge-queue or `workflow_call` trigger,
apart from the pinned macOS 14 / Intel compatibility legs in
`ci-macos-compat.yml` and `relay-publish-npm.yml`. It also asserts every paid macOS job references
`vars.MACOS_RUNNER_*` or a Blacksmith/Warp/Depot label so it can never silently
fall back to a free runner. Bare third-party provider labels (`blacksmith-*`, `warp-*`,
`depot-*`) stay allowed for deliberate single-runner pins. "Paid" there means
"not a GitHub-hosted free runner"; of the three, only Warp and Depot bill this
repository per minute, since Blacksmith is sponsored for this organization.
The CI health report counts those two. Keep new labels in
`.github/actionlint.yaml`.

The fleet-label guard refuses `tart-*` labels everywhere. Required jobs
continue to reference repository variables, so cutover and break-glass remain
configuration changes instead of workflow edits.

## CMUX-owned machine enrollment

Persistent CMUX hardware can be enrolled for repository-owned semantic workloads without becoming a direct required-CI runner. See [fleet-enrollment.md](fleet-enrollment.md).

The first reviewed role bindings are:

- `cmux_macos_native_build -> cmux.macos.dev-check@1`
- `cmux_linux_ci -> cmux.ci.guard@1`

CMUX owns those workload profiles and their pass/fail semantics through `scripts/ci/cmux_workload_profile.py`. Glaeda owns the machine enrollment record, candidate eligibility, local admission, and acceptance receipt that binds the exact canonical `cmux-workload-result/v1` bytes.

Enrollment does not register a GitHub runner or change repository runner variables. Required CI continues to use the policy above until a separately reviewed CI routing change promotes a fleet role.

## Direct physical-host runner boundary

Required GUI, test, Release, signing, and ordinary macOS jobs never route to
the persistent self-hosted mac-mini fleet (`cmux-mac-mini`, `studio1`,
`mac4-cmuxvnc*`, `cmux-austin-mini-*`). Those records can collide with cloud
labels and lack the isolated foreground GUI guarantees expected by runtime
tests.

There is no direct-host exception: no workflow names a mini's label or runner
group. Owned pools are reached only through `pr_runner_pool.py`, behind
`CI_PR_POOL_OWNED` (see "Pull request pool preference").
Every required macOS fallback still routes to the paid hosted path.
`check_no_self_hosted_fleet_runners` in
`tests/test_ci_self_hosted_guard.sh` rejects any required-job or generic fleet
route.
