<!-- Before drafting or revising this description, read ../STYLE.md. Lead with the problem and the resulting behavior, keep it proportional, and delete any section or checklist line that does not apply. -->

## Summary

<!-- The concrete problem, and what a user or API caller can do after this change. Explain as much of the mechanism as a reviewer needs to assess it; link deeper design or implementation detail. -->

## Testing

<!--
Say what ran, what passed, and what that establishes. Keep these apart:
- Tests added vs. tests executed. Name the command or CI lane that ran them; a green job whose tests were skipped is not coverage.
- Compiled vs. ran vs. checked live in a tagged build.
- Anything still unverified, stated once, next to the claim it limits.
The contributor verification ladder suggests the first useful check for each kind of change:
