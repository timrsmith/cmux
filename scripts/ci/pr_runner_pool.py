"""Pick the macOS pool a pull request CI run lands on.

ci.yml's `changes` job calls this once per run, and every pull-request macOS
job in the run reads the answer: compile admission, the app-host consumers
that follow it, tests-build-and-lag, cli-product-tests, the Claude wrapper
and remote daemon lanes. A run on a Blacksmith pool is never split across
pools, because the app-host product only loads under the Xcode that linked it
(#14163). A run on an owned pool may be, per job (see "Per-job placement"
below).

The run goes where it expects to wait least (pick()):

    vars.CI_PR_POOL_ORDER, comma-separated; by default
      blacksmith-12vcpu-macos-26   same macOS and Xcode as the lane, faster
      blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-26    vars.MACOS_RUNNER_PR today
      blacksmith-6vcpu-macos-15    macOS 15 Xcode (vars.CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_MACOS_15),
                                   the pool and Xcode main's own CI runs on

    expected wait = the queue its job joins, in rounds (queued jobs over
                    machines, POOL_CAPACITIES), times a job's length there
                    (JOB_MINUTES: 12vcpu jobs run about twice as fast), plus
                    COLD_ROUNDS on the macOS 15 pool, which has no
                    DerivedData seed for its Xcode and compiles cold

Owned pools come first in the default order and take the run while the jobs
they would hold start no later than this run's jobs would on the best
Blacksmith pool, within vars.CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS job lengths (default 1,
at most MAX_QUEUE_ROUNDS), and within the queue bound (owned_room()).
Otherwise the Blacksmith pool with the least expected wait takes it, the
earlier in the order on a tie.

The wait counts what holds a label now: jobs queued and running, and each
run since the snapshot at what it holds (young_charge(): admission and its
side lanes while it is younger than a job length, its whole peak after, when
its shards exist). So a run's shards that do not exist yet hold no idle mini:
a later run takes it, the shards join the label's queue when they exist, and
GitHub hands out runners in queue order. On 2026-09-25, 31 of 36 owned std
runners sat idle while 21 jobs queued on Blacksmith for 5 to 12 minutes,
because every in-flight run's future jobs held machines at its peak ("-5 of
15 root runners free"). The bound keeps those future jobs from growing the
queue without limit: everything the runs holding a label will need at their
peak (the janitor's `committed`, and the markers of runs since) plus this
run's peak stays within machines x (1 + rounds).

`CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS == '0'` is the kill switch and restores the old rule
exactly: an owned pool only when the run's peak is free counting every run's
peak (committed and markers), then the first Blacksmith pool with a free
machine (or at most vars.CI_PR_POOL_MAX_QUEUED jobs queued once it arrives),
and when every pool is full the one whose queue is shortest in rounds (a cold
pool counting COLD_ROUNDS more). A pool
holding a queued release or nightly job
is never chosen: pull requests must not delay those. Every Blacksmith pool
is sponsored, so cost is not a reason to prefer one.

`vars.CI_PR_POOL_OVERFLOW == '0'` turns this off. Only the labels in POOLS
are accepted, because each one's Xcode pin is known here.

Owned Macs (fleet RFC, cmuxterm-hq#573) join as class pools keyed by the
label glaeda issues, `glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>`. glaeda puts that label
only on a dedicated member whose Xcode at the pinned path reports the pinned
build, so the one label carries the class, the availability and the Xcode.
The version follows the pull-request lane's pin (vars.CMUX_CI_XCODE_APP_PR,
`/Applications/Xcode_26.6.app` -> `glaeda-std-xcode-26.6`), so moving the
pin moves the pool, and no runner carries the new label until glaeda has
verified the new Xcode on it. Owned pools are persistent: the machine
outlives the job. They take part only when `vars.CI_PR_POOL_OWNED == '1'`,
and then go first in the default order so Blacksmith is overflow. Their
capacity is the number of machines the fleet manifest gives each label,
published as vars.CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS (JSON, `{"glaeda-std-xcode-26.6": 12}`;
`{"std": 12}` and a bare `12` mean the same for the lane's Xcode pin).
The janitor's snapshot counts the jobs queued and running on each owned label
from the job listings it already makes, and `committed`: what the runs
holding the pool need at their peak, read from the marker each one uploads
(`macos-pool-persistent-<run>-<attempt>-<jobs>-<pool>`). No token beyond
GITHUB_TOKEN is needed. A run replayed since the snapshot (its pick not
known yet) counts REPLAYED_RUN_JOBS on the owned pool it could take and one
on its root runners. With the rounds at 0 every run counts its whole peak
against the machines, as before (owned_free()). An owned pool is
skipped when it has no slot count, and like every pool when the snapshot is
older than MAX_SNAPSHOT_MINUTES. With the org route App's token, the runners
API (this repository's and the org's glaeda-minis group, GitHub.runners())
gives the idle runners carrying each label, and every other runner
counts as busy (live_pools()); a label with no idle runner is charged the
snapshot's queue and the runs since it, since the API shows no queue.
A job on an owned pool may therefore wait up to about CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS
job lengths, and ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml gives a CI run's jobs that much
(QUEUE_ROUND_SECONDS per round) on top of its budget before it moves the
run to Blacksmith (owned_pool_rescue.py). An offline machine still counts
as a slot; what that gets wrong, ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml catches: a run whose
job waits on an owned pool past its budget is re-run on Blacksmith. A re-run
of failed jobs reuses this run's outputs, so a persistent choice also names
`retry_runner`, the Blacksmith pool every macOS job takes from attempt 2 on. The owned order is `std` (48 GB minis),
then `light` (16 GB), then the Blacksmith pools: one order for every job type.

Per-job placement (`vars.CI_PR_POOL_OWNED_SPLIT == '1'`): without it, a run
takes an owned pool only when its whole peak fits, so a full suite on 9
idle minis with 2 busy went to Blacksmith entirely and queued there. With it,
when no owned pool fits the whole run, the run takes the owned pool with the
most room (at least one job), and `owned_jobs` names the jobs that fit,
in priority order (priority()): compile admission first (the heavy compile,
and a mini keeps its warm DerivedData), then the GUI jobs (app-host shards by
index, tests-build-and-lag), which queue longest on Blacksmith, then the light
jobs (cli-product-tests, the remote daemon and Claude wrapper lanes, and
swift-package-tests when it builds no Release helper; see run_plan()).
Each job counts one machine; the jobs after admission reuse its machine.
Every other job of attempt 1 takes
`retry_runner`, the Blacksmith pool on the lane's Xcode. The shards and
cli-product-tests then run compile admission's product on another pool, which
is sound only because both run the same Xcode: the owned label names the
lane's pin, and on 2026-09-24 the minis and Blacksmith's 6vcpu and 12vcpu
macOS 26 images all reported Xcode 26.6 build 17F113. The product only ever
moves from a mini to Blacksmith (admission is always placed first), and
app_host_test_products.check_xcode refuses a product linked by a newer Xcode
than the consumer's, so a drift fails closed instead of crashing in dlopen.
With the split off, a run takes an owned pool only when all its
owned-eligible jobs fit.

Root jobs: glaeda gives compile admission, the app-host shards,
tests-build-and-lag and cli-product-tests (and any job it does not know) the
mini's one canonical-root token, and refuses such a job on a mini whose token
is taken. GitHub hands a pool-label job to any free runner, so a root job on
the pool label could land on a mini whose root was busy and cost a rescue
re-run. glaeda also labels one runner per mini
`glaeda-root-<class>-xcode-<version>` (root_label()), and a root job on that
label waits for a free root instead. CI_OWNED_POOL_SLOTS gives the root
runners' count beside the pool's (`{"std": 40, "root-std": 10}`). A pool with
a root count sends its placed root jobs (ROOT_JOBS) to the `root_runner`
output, and place() puts no more of them there than its root runners have
room for, by the same expected wait; a
pool without one keeps the pool label for every job. A root job also holds
one of the pool's machines, so it counts against both.

Side lanes (the Claude wrapper, remote daemon and package lanes, light jobs
that never touch a canonical root) take the pool's side label,
`glaeda-side-<class>-xcode-<version>` (side_label()), the other runners of
each mini, whenever the pool has a root count and more machines than root
runners (the `side_runner` output). On the pool label a side lane landed on a
root runner about half the time (11 of 21 on 2026-09-25, 06:30 to 09:00Z,
3,300 s of root-runner time) and kept a compile or product consumer off that
mini's root while it ran; on cmux7s and cmux9s, with one root, it blocked the
mini's only compile. A pool without a root count keeps the pool label.

Warm affinity: an owned Mac keeps compile admission's DerivedData
(owned_build_state.py), and ci-owned-warm-labels.yml labels its root runner
`glaeda-warm-<sha12>` for each main commit that build starts from cheaply
(owned_warm_labels.py). When admission is placed on a pool with a root count
and the runners were read live, the picker looks for an idle root runner of
that pool carrying the label of this run's merge base (MERGED_ONTO, the merge
commit's first parent) and, if one does, writes `admission_runner`, the JSON
array `["<root label>", "glaeda-warm-<sha12>"]`, which admission's attempt 1
takes as its runs-on. Otherwise it is empty and admission takes the root
label. The match is exact: v1 does not rank runners by commit distance. A
warm runner taken between the pick and the queue leaves admission waiting on
the label, and ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml moves it to Blacksmith.

GUI jobs (app-host shards, tests-build-and-lag) take an owned pool unless
`vars.CI_PR_POOL_OWNED_GUI == '0'`: the minis' runners are LaunchAgents in
the logged-in user's Aqua session, and each mini runs one job at a time. With
it 0 they take `retry_runner`. ci.yml turns off `unit_in_admission` for every
persistent pick, so the changed suites a compile admission would run itself
move to shard 8: glaeda gives admission the compile token, not the gui token. A run's owned peak
(`jobs`, and the marker's) counts only the jobs that may take the pool.

The queue comes from the queue janitor, which lists every in-flight run's
jobs each sweep and publishes what it saw as the `macos-pool-load` artifact.
Only a copy uploaded by a run on main of this repository counts, so no other
branch can steer the choice. The janitor sweeps every 10 to 30 minutes, so
every pull request run created since the snapshot is replayed through the
same rule first, one job each, filling a pool's idle slots (its capacity
less what is running) before they count as queued, so a burst of pushes
spreads across the pools instead of all taking the one that looked idle. That costs three
API requests (the artifact listing, its download redirect, and one page of
CI runs); listing jobs here would cost one per in-flight run on every push,
out of the GITHUB_TOKEN's shared budget of about 1000 an hour. A snapshot
older than MAX_SNAPSHOT_MINUTES counts as unknown.

A pull request from a fork into manaflow-ai/cmux gets no repository
variables. It follows the settings and lane the janitor copied into the
snapshot (so the kill switch reaches it too), never pins an Xcode (each job
selects the newest SDK 26 Xcode on the pool it lands on, and the product
consumers restate compile admission's empty pin), and only lands on
ephemeral Blacksmith pools.

A retry attempt (GITHUB_RUN_ATTEMPT above 1) never takes a persistent pool
either. A job queued on a persistent pool waits for it however long it stays
busy, so owned_pool_rescue.py cancels such a run and re-runs it, and the
re-run has to land somewhere with capacity. A rerun after a job failed on an
owned Mac lands on Blacksmith for the same reason. One exception, off unless
`vars.CI_OWNED_LIGHT_RETRY == '1'`: attempt 2 (LIGHT_RETRY_ATTEMPT) may take
a `light` owned pool, the next fleet tier, when its whole owned peak is free
there by the same rule as attempt 1, and only when github-actions[bot]
started it (GITHUB_TRIGGERING_ACTOR, the same gate as ci.yml's runs-on for
pr_refused_retry_runner). That attempt is the full re-run the
rescue starts for a job stuck queued on `std`, which picks again; the rescue
watches it, and a job stuck or refused there goes to Blacksmith on attempt
3. The order is std, then light, then Blacksmith. The `persistent` output
tells ci.yml to publish the marker the rescue watcher looks for.

Main's full suite: ci-main-full-suite.yml dispatches ci.yml on main about
32 times a day, each a full suite (compile admission, 7 app-host shards,
tests-build-and-lag, cli-product-tests). That is main's own code, so it may
take an owned pool like a same-repository pull request, and ci-macos.yml
already routes a `workflow_dispatch` on `refs/heads/main` through the same
inputs. It is placed like a pull request, split and queue rounds
(CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS) included, on the owned pools only; what does not
fit keeps its own route (MACOS_RUNNER_PR), since only an owned pool is a
candidate for it. With no Blacksmith pool to compare against, its jobs may
wait up to the queue rounds and the bound (owned_room()). CI_OWNED_MAIN_RESERVE (0 when unset) holds that many
machines and root runners back for pull requests; with a reserve it takes
an owned pool only whole, and only while its peak is free now (no queue
allowance). Its side lanes (the Claude wrapper and
remote daemon) route only for pull requests, so they are not in its plan.
Main's CI concurrency group holds one run at a time, so main holds at most
one run's machines. ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml watches it like a pull request.

Anything uncertain keeps today's route: an event other than pull_request or
main's dispatch, a
lane (MACOS_RUNNER_PR) naming another pool or unset (the documented way back
to the macOS 15 lane), an API error, a missing, stale or malformed snapshot,
or an invalid setting. The script then prints an empty runner, and every
job's own expression resolves exactly as before.
