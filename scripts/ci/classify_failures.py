"""Tell a CI failure the machine caused from one the pull request's code caused.

ci-failure-attribution.yml runs this on every completed pull request run of
CI (ci.yml), from main, under GITHUB_TOKEN. A PR's code never runs here: the
script reads the run's failed jobs, their logs and annotations, as data.

Each failed job gets a verdict from SIGNATURES, one table of log patterns:

  machine   the runner or its products failed: a runner hook refused the job,
            the compiled products did not restore, the CLI loaded package
            frameworks from another build, the runner went away, the runner
            lacks the Xcode the job pins. The job's
            test failures, if any, are not evidence about the code.
  code      a test recorded an issue, a compile or guard failed, and no
            machine signature matched.
  unknown   nothing in the table matched. The comment names the failed step.

Gate jobs (GATE_JOBS: ci-status and the other jobs that only read `needs`)
fail because another job did, so they are left out, as are cancelled jobs and
jobs whose log says they stopped for another job (verdict `derived`).

A machine signature counts only where the job failed: in a step that printed
an `##[error]`, or in a failure annotation. A cache save that warns about the
disk, or a script that spells a signature it never prints, does not count.

`act` writes the verdicts to the job summary and to one bot comment on the
pull request, edited in place, and re-runs the failed jobs when every failed
job is machine. GitHub's attempt counter bounds that: a failed attempt 1 or
2 is re-run, up to LAST_OWNED_ATTEMPT (attempt 2 goes back to the owned
labels like attempt 1, and a mini that is online but broken may fail it
again; attempt 3 goes to Blacksmith, which ends it), or a later attempt a
person started (this re-run then goes to Blacksmith), only while it is still
the run's latest attempt, the pull request is open and its head has not
moved. owned_pool_rescue.py may re-run a refused
job first; the attempt check then skips, and GitHub refuses a second re-run of
a run in progress. A cancelled run is reported, never re-run: the rescue
cancels a stuck run before its own full re-run, and a re-run of failed jobs
here would pre-empt it.

A code or unknown job's failed steps also give its concrete failures
(extract_failures: failed tests with file:line, compile errors, crashes,
warning-budget overages, CLI help contract failures; system and cache `error:`
noise dropped), and each gets an owner:

  yours             its file is one the pull request changes, or tests one
  also red on main  main's latest red full-suite run (the data main_full_suite.py
                    writes into its open issue) fails the same way
  new in this PR    neither: most likely the pull request's

The comment's first line is the verdict in those words. A pull request that
merged before its CI finished still gets the comment (fix forward on main).
A green run whose macOS jobs never ran, on a pull request that changes the
app, says so instead of "passes". The comment records the head it speaks for:
when CI starts on a newer head (workflow_run `requested`) or an older head's
run completes, a comment about another head is rewritten to "pending".
