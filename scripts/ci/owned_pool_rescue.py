"""Move a pull request CI run off a busy persistent macOS pool.

pr_runner_pool.py picks one pool per run. When that pool is owned (a
`glaeda-<class>-xcode-<version>` label, pr_runner_pool.persistent), the jobs
it names in `owned_jobs` take it and the rest take retry_runner (Blacksmith).
GitHub never re-routes a queued job: one on the owned pool waits for it
however long the pool stays busy. ci-owned-pool-rescue.yml runs this script
from the default branch, with Actions write, as one sweeper (SWEEP=1,
sweep()): it finds the runs placed on an owned pool by their fixed-name
markers and gives each a thread running follow(), the per-run watch described
below. A dispatch with a run's id (WATCH_RUN_ID) watches that run alone,
checked as a workflow_run event's run would be.

The script waits for ci.yml's `changes` job, which runs the picker. When the
picker chose a persistent pool, that job uploads a marker artifact
(`macos-pool-persistent-<run id>-<attempt>-<jobs>-<pool>`, the jobs and pool
for the janitor's count); no marker means the run is on an
ephemeral pool and the watch ends. Otherwise it watches the run's jobs until the
run finishes. If a job on the persistent pool is still queued with no runner
after the budget (CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS, 90 by default), it confirms the
pull request head has not moved, cancels the run, waits for it to finish, and
re-runs it. The re-run is attempt 2, and pr_runner_pool.py never gives a
retry attempt the std pool, so every macOS job of the re-run lands on
Blacksmith together, unless CI_OWNED_LIGHT_RETRY is 1 (passed here as
OWNED_LIGHT_RETRY). Then that full re-run runs `changes` again and may take
the `light` owned pool, so the watch follows attempt 2 the way it follows
attempt 1: it waits for `changes` and looks for attempt 2's own marker (the
marker name carries the attempt), because a macOS job gets its label only
after the picker has chosen. A job stuck or refused on light has its failed
and cancelled jobs re-run on attempt 3, which always takes Blacksmith. With
the variable off, the full re-run is not watched.

An owned runner can also refuse a job it was handed: glaeda's job-started
hook exits 1 when the host is busy (its lock is held), and the job fails
within seconds, before any step of the workflow succeeds. GitHub does not
retry it, so the pull request would stay red until someone re-ran it. A job
on the persistent pool that failed within REFUSAL_SECONDS of starting, with
its runner setup step failed or no workflow step succeeded, counts as refused
(compile admission's `always()` metrics steps still succeed after a refusal): the watcher confirms the head has
not moved, cancels the run if it is still going, and re-runs its failed jobs.
That attempt 2 reuses attempt 1's outputs, so every macOS job in it takes
retry_runner, the Blacksmith pool the picker named, and what already passed
(compile admission, say) is kept. A run on an owned pool is split across pools
anyway (per-job placement, CI_PR_POOL_OWNED_SPLIT), which is
sound only because both sides run the same Xcode: retry_runner is a macOS
26 pool on the lane's pin, the pin the owned label names, and on 2026-09-24
both the minis and Blacksmith's 6vcpu and 12vcpu macOS 26 images reported
Xcode 26.6 build 17F113. If those builds ever differ, re-run the whole run
here instead (rescue with failed_only=False).

A refused job goes back to the fleet once before Blacksmith: attempt 2 of a
re-run of failed jobs may take the owned pool again (the job's runs-on reads
`github.run_attempt == 2 && inputs.pr_refused_retry_runner` first, where the
job can run on an owned Mac). GitHub delivers no `requested` event for a
re-run (run 36059281883's attempt 2 started no rescue), so the watch that
re-ran the failed jobs goes on to watch attempt 2 itself, for owned jobs
only, and stops at the first look that lists no job on an owned label. A job
refused, or queued past the budget, on attempt 2 gets the run cancelled if it
is still going and its failed and cancelled jobs re-run once more, keeping the
jobs that passed; attempt 3 and later always take retry_runner on
Blacksmith, so a busy fleet costs at most one extra refusal and never loops.
Attempt 2 of a re-run of failed jobs needs no marker: `changes` is not
re-run, so the watch follows any job on an owned label and stops when none
appears.

E2E runs (test-e2e.yml) are watched the same way. Its `runner` job runs
e2e_runner_pool.py, which may pick an owned pool, and uploads the same marker
(with 1 job). An E2E run is a workflow_dispatch, not a pull request, so there
is no head to re-check, and its build and test jobs are not a split that can
break: from attempt 2 on both take the runner job's retry_label, a macOS 26
Blacksmith pool on the same Xcode build. So a stuck or refused E2E job gets
its failed and cancelled jobs re-run, keeping a build that passed, and the
follow-on watch of attempt 2 finds no owned job and stops. A stuck E2E run
that finished some other way (a newer dispatch in its concurrency group
cancelled it) is not re-run, since that would cancel the newer one. Its
watch lasts E2E_WATCH_LIMIT_SECONDS, since its test job queues only after a
sibling wait and a build.

Main's full-suite dispatch of ci.yml (ci-main-full-suite.yml, a
workflow_dispatch on main) is watched exactly like a pull request run:
pr_runner_pool.py may put it on an owned pool like a pull request, and its
`changes` job uploads the
same marker. It has no pull request, so in place of the pull request head it
checks main's HEAD: once main has moved past the run's commit, a stuck run is
cancelled but not re-run, because its completion makes
ci-main-full-suite.yml dispatch the newer HEAD, and a re-run would only queue
the older commit behind it in main's CI concurrency group. A refused job's
failed jobs are re-run whether or not main moved, so a fleet refusal never
leaves main's run red.

Dispatches of test-ios.yml and ios-screenshots.yml are watched exactly like an
E2E run (DISPATCH_WORKFLOW_PATHS). Their `runner` job runs ios_runner_pool.py,
which may put the iOS jobs on an owned pool with the glaeda-ios-sim capability
label, and uploads the same marker; from attempt 2 on every macOS job takes
its retry_runs_on, the Blacksmith pool. A job asking for a capability label no
idle mini carries waits like any other queued owned job, so it is moved after
the same budget.

Side-lane workflows (SIDE_WORKFLOW_PATHS) have no picker. On attempt 1 of a
same-repository pull request run, their light macOS jobs take
vars.CI_SIDE_LANE_RUNNER, a glaeda-side-* label that only the minis' non-root
runners carry, and every later attempt takes the job's Blacksmith default. So
the first job on an owned label marks the run as on a persistent pool (a job
behind a Linux gate appears once the gate ends), and the watch stops once
every owned job has been accepted, which a side lane's few short jobs reach in
minutes. A refused side-lane job gets the run's failed jobs re-run; a stuck
one gets the run cancelled and its failed and cancelled jobs re-run, keeping
the jobs that had already finished. That re-run is on Blacksmith, so it is
not followed. A stuck run that finished some other way (a newer push cancelled
it) is not re-run. Its watch lasts SIDE_WATCH_LIMIT_SECONDS.

A job's wait is measured from the later of its `created_at` and the first
time the watcher saw it queued, so a job record created before its `needs`
were met can never count as already past the budget.

It stops watching, doing nothing, when:
- owned pools are off (CI_PR_POOL_OWNED is not 1), before any API request;
- the run is not attempt 1 of a same-repository pull request run of ci.yml
  or a side-lane workflow, of main's full-suite dispatch of ci.yml, or of a
  dispatch in DISPATCH_WORKFLOW_PATHS;
- a side-lane run finished with no job on an owned label, or the fleet
  accepted all of its owned jobs;
- on the attempt 2 it re-ran from failed jobs, no job runs on an owned label;
- on the attempt 2 it re-ran in full, `changes` finished without that
  attempt's marker, or CI_OWNED_LIGHT_RETRY is off (not watched at all);
- `changes` finished without a marker: the run is on an ephemeral pool.
  When ci.yml started the watch for late placement (LATE_PLACEMENT=1), it
  first waits for ci-macos.yml's late-placement job and follows the run if
  that job uploaded its marker (it moved jobs onto owned root runners);
- the run finished, or the watch limit passed.

Request budget: the reads use a manaflow-glaeda-route App token when the
workflow could mint one (READ_TOKEN; its own 5000 requests an hour), else
GITHUB_TOKEN, which allows about 1000 requests an hour for the whole
repository. Cancels and re-runs always use GITHUB_TOKEN (GitHub.__doc__). A run on an ephemeral pool costs a jobs listing every
POLL_SECONDS until `changes` finishes (usually two or three) plus one artifact
listing. A run on a persistent pool adds a jobs listing every POLL_SECONDS
while one of its jobs waits for a runner and every IDLE_POLL_SECONDS otherwise,
about 30 in all for an hour-long run. A read that fails is retried
READ_ATTEMPTS times before the watch gives up; a failed cancel or re-run is
never retried.

A CI run's owned jobs may wait on purpose. pr_runner_pool.py puts a run on
an owned pool while its jobs are expected to start there no later than on
Blacksmith, and within CI_PR_POOL_QUEUE_ROUNDS job lengths (default 1, at
most MAX_QUEUE_ROUNDS). No idle machine is held for jobs a run creates later
(its shards): they join the label's queue behind whatever arrived meanwhile,
and the picker keeps that queue within machines x (1 + rounds) by every
run's peak. So any owned job of a CI run may wait up to about that long, and
its budget is the pool's expected wait plus a margin:
CI_OWNED_POOL_RESCUE_SECONDS plus QUEUE_ROUND_SECONDS per round
(queue_seconds(), 930 seconds by default), under the watch limit so a stuck
job is still moved. With the rounds at 0 the picker takes an owned pool
only with machines free now, and the budget is the configured one. A
test-ios.yml or test-e2e.yml run's picker queues by the same rounds, so it
gets the same allowance. The configured budget alone is an iOS screenshots
or side-lane run's (#14391: no picker; the side lanes share the
runners PR runs queue on, so they are moved to Blacksmith more often), and a
re-run of failed jobs'.
